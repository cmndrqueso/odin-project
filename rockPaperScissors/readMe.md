# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This was built as an assignment for The Odin Project. 
This is a game that can be played in a browser console.
The game is initiallized by typing `game();` into the console.
The game will play for 5 rounds. It can be terminated by pressing
"3". Any other input will reset the game.

## Future Considerations

In the future this game will have a GUI, for now the project requirement is strictly in the console.
